# protege-domainowl
A profile of Protege to query specific domain knowledge based on the selected generic ontology

To compile and install the profile, the PROTEGE_HOME enviroment var
must be set firstly. PROTEGE_HOME must be the path where the protege
application is installed.

Thanks to the guide document from http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/PluginAnatomy#Adding_a_View_Plugin_to_the_Plugin.xml_file. 
The document teached me how to start to build a profile of Protege.
